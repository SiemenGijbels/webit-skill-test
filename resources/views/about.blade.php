    <h1 class="title">About Fauxtion</h1>

    <p class="body-text">Welcome to Fauxtion, your number one source for all things vintage. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of pre-loved designer furniture, with a focus on quality, design, and recurring trends.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Founded in 2019 by Herbert Fauxtion, Fauxtion has come a long way from its beginnings in Antwerp as a purely physical store. When Herbert first started out, his passion for pre-loved designer pieces —whether it be furniture, clothing, perfumes etc— drove him to quit his job as a stock broker so that Fauxtion can offer you the best pieces Antwerp has to offer. We now serve customers all over the BeNeLux region (and soon the WHOLE of Europe!), and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.</p>
    <p class="body-text">We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Sincerely, <br> Herbert Fauxtion</p>
